<!-- <p>Hi I am the cosmic mafia,  and  a quick disclaimer, i do not spread or support conspiracy theorists.  I am clearly stating and explaining you what I am doing and why. I am not a UFOlogist, or a conspiracy theorist I am a researcher who turns out valid facts to you, I am very sure and informing you as early as possible, you might not classify me as a conspiracy theorist or a liar If my language gets rude, i am sorry, because i am passionate. I need not to convince people that they exist,  but to convince them that they can exist and they are here. Anyone if asks me that where is the evidence, I say that there are many cases, like the Spitsbergen case of Russia, <br /><br />
              And the Lonnie Zamora incident which sparked off a interest in Sir J Allen Hynek's mind. Even though there are so many plausible events and cases, we still are stubborn and want to just ignore, why? <br /><br />
             And if someone asks for evidence, a simple answer, we didn't know who gods were, who jesus was, we are just believing in stories passed from generations either verbally or either in written form, <br /><br />
             This is the art of human's forgetfulness. We see the Eye of Horus as a religious symbol, but it was a cross sectional diagram of a vehicle. Simply we would make something in 21'st century and  the people from probably 50th century would think its a religious symbol and start workshipping us. Even if this example doesn't bother you, just think that there are too many cases, events whose correct explanation is still not given by anyone, the normal public doesn't know. And the main reason that the public doesn't know  is the control of media, society, thinking is unknowingly done by the feudal rulers.  <br />
             Feudal rulers overt and covert must maintain control over their respective populations, and to do this they must control the society’s resources, information, technology, industry, media, religion, science, etc. If rulers lose control over their subjects they are subject to being overthrown by dissenters. <br />
              It’s a natural thing for rulers to suppress and control information relating to extraterrestrial knowledge and technology, as it is with other important information. Today’s feudal rulers have had centuries to perfect the increasingly subtle means of control and suppression of truths that could lead dissenters to rise up and overthrow them. <br />
              The slave master only allows the slave knowledge to do his or her job and no more, because to know more would be to invite rebellion. This master-slave concept of need to know has been incorporated into modern day national security top secret classification systems, where the need to know and SAPs, Special Access Programs, are often not even controlled by governments, but by corporations which in turn are controlled by the globalists.  I believe our situation in regards to the globalist elite and the intelligent universe, is similar to that of the populations of North Korea in relation to its elite and the rest of the world. The only difference is a matter of scale. The North Korean tyrants have managed to isolate and control public access to technology and knowledge available through special access to other countries. <br /><br />
              On one hand the North Korean elite suppress and control access by their masses to the rest of the world, even to the point of starving the masses. Yet, on the other hand they exploit their elite access to the rest of the world to their advantage and live very well with the best technology the world has to offer, and to even use that that superior technology to propagandize and suppress their people. Throughout history autocratic regimes accumulate wealth and technological luxuries for the elite that are not available to the ordinary person. For instance, in Roman times the elite had running water, flush toilets and hot baths, all luxuries at the time, that have only became commonplace in the 20th century and yet even today many people still do not have these basics.  In a sense on a small scale the autocratic elite create a small breakaway civilization more advanced that the country as a whole in which they live. This breakaway civilization draws on the resources and the labor of the people in a parasitic manner, taking much more than is given back to the host society.  I think the reader as he or she becomes better informed; will come to realize that the global elite are doing the exact same thing to global populations as national elites have done to their individual countries. I intend to make the case, in this book, that the globalist elite have used their global networks of corporate trusts and monopolies to isolate global populations from knowledge about extraterrestrial reality in order to further their own selfish interests. There is nothing special about the elite taking such a stance; they are subverting all other aspects of global society and the environment for their self-interest. <br />
              The covert feudal elite have subverted UFO/ET understanding amongst global populations by creating and supporting a very effective secret policy of denial and ridicule around the UFO/ET subject through official institutions including the mainstream media which they control. It would be well to remember the words of the first director of the CIA, Admiral Roscoe Henry Hillenkoetter.⁴ “Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe the unknown flying objects are nonsense.” <br /><br />
              There exist declassified CIA documents that discuss the creation and implementation of this wall of ridicule and denial around the extraterrestrial subject. Investigator Jim Marrs author of the book; ‘Rule by Secrecy’ did a good job of summarizing how this official policy of denial and ridicule came to be in his article, UFO’s Over Washington Prompted Policy of Denial and Ridicule. Jim Marrs said, “With the CIA-dominated Robertson Panel, the U.S. Government thus began a conscious program of dismissal and ridicule regarding UFOs, which has continued; with only minor interruptions, to this day.” <br />
              This national and international policy of denial and ridicule filters down into the public domain and we have to look no further than to Nick Pope. Nick now an advocate for disclosure, once headed the UK’s Ministry of Defense UFO Office. <br /> <br />
             
             Top Secret classified Titanium mining operation and colony has been in operation since the 1960s on the moon.   It is widely assumed that black operations are 50 years advanced over public knowledge so go figure!   Did we ever stop making manned missions to the moon or like with electrogravitic technologies,  it just went black and into the hands of the Globalist Feudalistic Elite’s breakaway civilization?
